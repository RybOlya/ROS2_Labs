# ROS2 First homework
## Initial letter drawing
- Implementation of a ROS2 node that operates the turtles from the turtlesim package 
- Realised by moving the turtles using /turtle1/cmd_vel and /turtle2/cmd_vel topics to draw my initial letters O R (the first turtle draws the first letter of my name, and the second turtle draws the first letter of my surname). 
- The letter is in Latin alphabet.
